## THIS MAY NOT WORK, AND I WILL NOT PROVIDE UPDATES, IF U WANT UPDATES OR DONT TRUST DOWNLOADING THIS FILE ON YOUR PC, RUN IT ON REPLIT.

do not skid, look at anti-skid-license.txt, if u do skid i can and may take you to small claims court.

HOW TO SETUP:

# WHEN U DOWNLOAD THE FILE, OPEN TERMINAL AND RUN "Npm Install dotenv" OR THIS WONT WORK.

add your discord invite to .env

First go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and make a new application. (get the oauth2 link, look it up if u dont know how.)
Then customize it and shit, after that get the token found on the "bot" section, and turn on ALL INTENTS OR THIS WILL NOT WORK.

After doing that go to the .env file and put it in that file.

then make a new gmail (add it to the .env file.), then go to "manage my google account" then go to security and then 2step verification, Sign in if u need too. Then add a 2fa thing, such as sms 2fa. then go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and make a new password, COPY IT AND PUT IT IN "SMTP_PASSWORD1" in .env file.

repeat again if u need to. if u do put it in "SMTP_EMAIL2" and "SMTP_PASSWORD2".



And there u go bot is working.
